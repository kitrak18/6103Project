    "# Section 1: Introduction\n",
    "  \n",
    "The popularity of smartphones has increased greatly every year since the release of the first smart phone, with approximately 10 billion (https://www.statista.com/) smartphones sold worldwide since then. This is 40% of the global population. Additionally, Android phones enjoy about 85% of the smart phone market share globally (https://www.statista.com/). Since the meteoric rise of the smartphone and tech industries, many app developers have taken the opportunity to develop their own apps for different operating systems and made available to download on multiple platforms. Google Play Store is one of the main platforms and has 2.7 billion apps available (https://www.statista.com/). On average, people spend around 3 hours a day on their phones (https://hackernoon.com/). Due to the huge popularity of apps, there is a wide variety of genres available for every type of audience with a wide range of pricing. Since many people invest so much time and effort into apps, app data has become an interesting and relevant topic to conduct research on.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This report focuses mainly on a sample of apps from the Google Play Store, where the composition of this sample will be analysed in depth and modeled to predict and classify app ratings. The rest of section 1 will describe our project objectives as well as the dataset. Section 2 will cover our pre-processing methods. Section 3 will go through exploratory data analysis. Section 4 will focus on our model building and evaluation. Finally, we will wrap up with our results and conclusions."
